# Python Mini Projects


Hi, ðŸ’— I created some mini python projects for you to try! 

Just paste the code into your complier or run it with bash! 

Some projects may require you to run the script, no worries, it's super easy! If you remember from HelloWorld_0101 all you do is clone the repository or download the python script in each code (if provided) . Then just run the script in your terminal or command prompt! Thats it ^_^



## Requirements

- Python
- (Optional) Eclipse
